# Machine Learning (MATLAB) - *K*-Means Clustering and Principle Component Analysis

Machine Learning course from Stanford University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/8).

### Introduction
We will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. And will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

### Environment
- macOS Catalina (version 10.15.3)
- MATLAB 2018 b

### Dataset
- ex7data1.mat
- ex7data2.mat
- ex7faces.mat
